## Overview
This project focuses on image processing and includes 8 modules designed to perform different tasks. Each module addresses a specific aspect of image processing.
## Modules
1. Module 1: Solving the Quadratic Equation

Solve quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
Determine the nature of the equation: Has solutions, No solutions, or Infinite solutions.

2. Module 2: Face Recognition

Face detection and recognition of up to 5 people in one frame.

3. Module 3: Object Identification

Detect various types of objects such as people, bicycles, cars, etc.

4. Module 4: Handwritten Numbers Recognition

Recognize handwritten digits using the Mnist dataset.

5. Module 5: Fruit Identification

Identify different fruits using a pre-trained model.

6. Module 6: Image Processing

Includes chapters 3, 4, 5, and 9 for image processing.

7. Module 7: Counting Fingers

Count your fingers (1 to 5). This can recognize 2 hands in one frame.

8. Module 8: Control the volume by Hand Gesture

You can increase or decrease the volume by moving your hand up and down.

9. Module 9: Fire Detection

Recognize fire using the model I trained myself.

10. Module 10: Hand Sign Identification

Recognize 3 hand symbols: A, B, C.
